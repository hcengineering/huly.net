# Problems not solve

- [x] Basic functional implementaion and zeromq transport based implementation.

  - [x] basic tests
  - [x] basic rate limit logic

- Add opentelementry for monitoring/logging

- Add docker + real network benchmark test

- Retry logic - need more carefully track request/response retry.

- Rate limit logic not implemented, unclear how to manage it now.

- Memory overhelming issues

  1. Allow network based streaming of responses.
  2. Add limits per workspace request?

- Work on more real life examples. Integrate into platform.

- Not sure if warmup/ping is really needed.
